About This Project

This is a classic Snake Game developed in Python. The game allows a player to control a snake, eat food, and grow in size while avoiding collisions with the walls or itself.
I created it using AI-assisted coding (Cursor IDE with Vibe) as part of my exploration into how AI tools can support programming tasks.

What I Learned

The concept of a game loop and how to refresh game states continuously.
Handling user input (arrow keys) for real-time movement.
Using libraries like Pygame (if thatâ€™s in your code) for rendering and event management.
How to debug and understand AI-generated code, making small adjustments to ensure smooth gameplay.
